# 🛠️ Aethriad Project Workflow

This document outlines the general workflow we follow at **Aethriad** to plan, design, build, deploy and maintain our projects — from the first idea to long-term support.


## 🧠 1. Ideation

Every project begins with a clear purpose. During the ideation phase, we:

- Define the problem or opportunity.
- Research similar tools or competitors.
- Brainstorm potential features and solutions.
- Document the initial concept using markdown notes.
- Create a Linear issue or roadmap entry to track progress.

> The goal is to align the team and validate the idea before moving to design.


## 🎨 2. Design

We visualize the experience and define the user interface. During this phase:

- Wireframes and mockups are created in Figma.
- We create assets via Figma, Gimp or Blender.
- User flows and interactions are mapped.
- Accessibility and responsiveness are taken into account.
- The design is shared for feedback and refined iteratively.

> We aim for clarity, usability, and consistency with our design system.


## 💻 3. Development

Once the design is approved, we move to implementation. We:

- Set up or reuse a Next.js or React project scaffold.
- Use Linear to track tasks.
- Follow clean code and TypeScript best practices.
- Create components using Tailwind and shadcn/ui.
- Collaborate via GitHub PRs, using conventional commits and clear descriptions.

> Code should be readable, testable, and scalable from day one.


## 🧪 4. Testing

We ensure stability and confidence before release by:

- Writing unit tests with libraries like Jest or Vitest.
- Adding integration and E2E tests if applicable (Playwright / Cypress).
- Running tests automatically with GitHub Actions.
- Peer reviewing code thoroughly before merging to main.

> A feature isn’t complete until it’s tested and reviewed.


## 🚀 5. Delivery

Once validated, we ship the project or feature to users:

- Use Vercel or other platforms for deployment.
- Tag releases using semantic versioning.
- Share changelogs and relevant documentation.
- Notify the team through Discord.

> Deliver early, deliver often — and document what you ship.


## 🔧 6. Maintenance

Ongoing work ensures our code stays healthy and up to date:

- Fix bugs, monitor feedback, and track performance.
- Update dependencies and tech stack as needed.
- Plan enhancements or refactors in future sprints.
- Archive deprecated features with clear version history.

> We build for the long term — software should evolve with its users.


Stay true to your commitment to perfection 🪡
